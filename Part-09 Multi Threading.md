## What is the need for Threads in Java?
</summary>
In Java, threads are used to achieve concurrent execution of tasks within a program. A thread is a lightweight unit of execution that can run concurrently with other threads, allowing multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously.

There are several reasons why threads are used in Java:

**1. Responsiveness:** Threads enable responsiveness in programs by allowing tasks to run concurrently. For example, if you have a graphical user interface (GUI) application, you can use threads to perform time-consuming operations in the background without freezing the user interface. This ensures that the application remains responsive to user interactions.

**2. Parallelism:** Threads can be used to achieve parallelism, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously on different processor cores. This can lead to improved performance and efficiency in certain scenarios. For instance, in a multi-core system, you can divide a large computational task into smaller sub-tasks and execute them concurrently on different threads, effectively utilizing the available processing power.

**3. Asynchronous Operations:** Threads are useful for performing asynchronous operations. For example, if you need to fetch data from a remote server, you can create a thread to handle the network communication while the main thread continues to execute other tasks. This allows your program to continue functioning without waiting for the network operation to complete.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of threads in Java:

        public class ThreadExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task("Task 1"));
                Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task("Task 2"));
                
                thread1.start(); // Start executing Task 1 in a separate thread
                thread2.start(); // Start executing Task 2 in a separate thread
                
                // Perform other tasks in the main thread
                System.out.println("Main thread is performing other tasks...");
            }
        }

        class Task implements Runnable {
            private String name;
            
            public Task(String name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
            
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Executing " + name);
                
                // Simulate some work
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Sleep for 2 seconds
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                
                System.out.println(name + " completed");
            }
        }

In this example, two instances of the Task class are created, representing two different tasks. Each task is executed in a separate thread using the Thread class. The run() method of the Task class contains the code that will be executed in each thread. The Thread.sleep() method is used to simulate some work being done. While the tasks are being executed in separate threads, the main thread continues to perform other tasks concurrently.

## How do you create a thread?
</summary>
In Java, you can create a thread by following one of the two approaches: extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Here's how you can create a thread using both approaches:

1. Extending the Thread class:

        public class MyThread extends Thread {
            public void run() {
                // Code to be executed in the thread
            }
        }

To start the thread, you create an instance of your MyThread class and call the start() method:

        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();

The run() method contains the code that will be executed in the thread. You can override this method to define the behavior of your thread.

2. Implementing the Runnable interface:

        public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
            public void run() {
                // Code to be executed in the thread
            }
        }

To start the thread, you create an instance of your MyRunnable class and pass it to the Thread constructor. Then, you call the start() method on the Thread object:

        MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();

The run() method in the Runnable implementation contains the code that will be executed in the thread.

Both approaches allow you to define the behavior of the thread in the run() method. When the start() method is called, a new thread is created, and the run() method is executed concurrently in that thread. It's important to note that you should not call the run() method directly; instead, use the start() method, which handles the thread creation and execution for you.

By creating threads, you can achieve concurrent execution of tasks, enabling responsiveness, parallelism, and asynchronous operations in your Java programs.

## What are the different states of a Thread?
</summary>
In Java, a thread can be in one of several states throughout its lifecycle. The different states of a thread are as follows:

1. New: When a thread is created but not yet started, it is in the "New" state. In this state, the thread has been instantiated, but the start() method has not been called yet.

2. Runnable: When the start() method is called on a thread, it transitions to the "Runnable" state. In this state, the thread is eligible to be scheduled for execution by the thread scheduler. However, it does not necessarily mean that the thread is currently running. It is simply ready to run and waiting for its turn on the CPU.

3. Running: When the thread scheduler selects a thread from the "Runnable" state and starts executing its run() method, the thread enters the "Running" state. In this state, the thread is actively executing its code.

4. Blocked/Waiting: A thread can transition to the "Blocked" or "Waiting" state under certain conditions. For example, if a thread is waiting for a lock to be released by another thread, it enters the "Blocked" state. If a thread is waiting for a certain condition to be met, such as the availability of a resource, it enters the "Waiting" state. In both cases, the thread is not actively executing its code and is waiting for some event to occur.

5. Timed Waiting: Similar to the "Waiting" state, a thread can enter the "Timed Waiting" state when it is waiting for a certain condition, but with a specified timeout. The thread will remain in this state until the condition is met or the timeout expires.

6. Terminated: A thread enters the "Terminated" state when its run() method completes or when an unhandled exception occurs within the thread. In this state, the thread has finished its execution and cannot be restarted.

It's important to note that the exact state transitions and behavior of threads can be influenced by factors such as thread scheduling, synchronization, and blocking operations. The Java Thread API provides methods and mechanisms to control and manage thread states effectively.

## What is priority of a thread? How do you change the priority of a thread?
</summary>
In Java, the priority of a thread is an integer value that determines the relative importance or scheduling preference of the thread. Thread priorities range from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest), where the default priority is 5. The thread scheduler uses the thread's priority to decide which thread should be executed when multiple threads are in the "Runnable" state.

You can change the priority of a thread using the setPriority() method provided by the Thread class. Here's an example that demonstrates how to change the priority of a thread:

          public class PriorityExample {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task(), "Thread 1");
                  Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task(), "Thread 2");
                  
                  thread1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Set Thread 1 priority to maximum
                  thread2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // Set Thread 2 priority to minimum
                  
                  thread1.start();
                  thread2.start();
              }
          }

          class Task implements Runnable {
              public void run() {
                  System.out.println("Executing task in " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
              }
          }

In this example, two instances of the Task class are created, representing two different tasks to be executed in separate threads. The setPriority() method is used to set the priority of each thread.

The Thread.MAX_PRIORITY and Thread.MIN_PRIORITY constants represent the maximum and minimum thread priorities, respectively. You can also use values between 1 and 10 to set a specific priority.

When the threads are started using the start() method, the thread scheduler will take the thread priorities into account when deciding which thread to execute. However, it's important to note that thread priorities are platform-dependent and might not have a significant impact on thread scheduling on all systems.

It's generally recommended to use thread priorities judiciously and rely on other synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, to ensure correct and reliable thread coordination. Thread priorities are typically used as hints to the scheduler, but the final decision is ultimately determined by the underlying platform and JVM implementation.
