### What are Generics?
</summary>

Generics in Java are a way to create classes and methods that can work with different types of data. This is done by using a type parameter, which is a placeholder for a specific type. For example, the following generic method can work with any type of data:
```
public <T> void doSomething(T data) {
  // Do something with data
}
```

This method can be used like this:
```
doSomething(1); // Works with integers
doSomething("Hello"); // Works with strings
```

Generics can be used to make code more reusable and maintainable. They can also help to prevent errors, such as trying to use an invalid type of data in a method.

Here are some of the benefits of using generics in Java:
- Reusability:
Generic classes and methods can be reused with different types of data, which makes code more concise and maintainable.
- Type safety:
Generics help to prevent errors, such as trying to use an invalid type of data in a method.
- Performance:
Generics can improve performance by allowing the compiler to optimize code.

Generics are a powerful feature that can be used to make Java code more reusable, maintainable, and efficient.
