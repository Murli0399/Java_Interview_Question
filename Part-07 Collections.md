## Why do we need Collections in Java?
</summary>
A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture. In order to implement a new feature or a class, there is no need to define a framework. However, an optimal object-oriented design always includes a framework with a collection of classes such that all the classes perform the same kind of task. Before Collection Framework(or before JDK 1.2) was introduced, the standard methods for grouping Java objects (or collections) were Arrays or Vectors, or Hash tables. All of these collections had no common interface. Therefore, though the main aim of all the collections is the same, the implementation of all these collections was defined independently and had no correlation among them. And also, it is very difficult for the users to remember all the different methods, syntax, and constructors present in every collection class.

Collection Framework is a powerful framework in java. This framework defines the most common methods that can be used for any collection of objects. But the question arises that we have an array concept in java then why we need collection framework in java? Now letâ€™s see that why we need collection framework in java with some valid points of difference between array and collection.

## What are the important interfaces in the Collection Hierarchy?
</summary>
The Java Collections Framework provides several important interfaces in its collection hierarchy. These interfaces define common behaviors and operations that are shared among different types of collections. Here are some of the important interfaces in the Collection Hierarchy:

- **Collection** This is the root interface in the collection hierarchy. It defines the basic operations that are common to all collections, such as adding, removing, and querying elements. The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface, which enables iteration over the elements in the collection.

- **List** The List interface represents an ordered collection of elements where duplicate elements are allowed. It provides additional operations for element insertion, removal, and retrieval at specific positions. Implementations of List include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

- **Set** The Set interface represents a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It defines methods for adding and removing elements, as well as checking for the presence of specific elements. Common implementations of Set are HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

- **Queue** The Queue interface models a collection that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It provides methods for adding elements at the end and removing elements from the beginning of the queue. The Queue interface extends the Collection interface and includes additional methods for queue-specific operations. Implementations of Queue include LinkedList, PriorityQueue, and ArrayDeque.

- **Map** The Map interface represents a mapping between keys and values, where each key is unique. It allows you to store and retrieve values based on their associated keys. The Map interface provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing key-value pairs. Common implementations of Map are HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

- **Iterator** The Iterator interface provides a way to iterate over the elements in a collection. It defines methods for checking if there are more elements, retrieving the next element, and removing elements during iteration.

These interfaces, along with their respective implementations, form the foundation of the Java Collections Framework. They provide a wide range of functionality for working with collections and enable you to choose the most appropriate collection type based on your specific requirements.

## What are the important methods that are declared in the Collection Interface?
</summary>
The Collection interface in the Java Collections Framework defines a set of common methods that are shared by all collection types. Here are some of the important methods declared in the Collection interface:

- **int size()** Returns the number of elements in the collection.

- **boolean isEmpty()** Checks if the collection is empty (contains no elements).

- **boolean contains(Object obj)** Checks if the collection contains the specified object.

- **boolean add(E obj)** Adds the specified element to the collection.

- **boolean remove(Object obj)** Removes a single instance of the specified object from the collection.

- **boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)** Checks if the collection contains all the elements in the specified collection.

- **boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)** Adds all the elements from the specified collection to the collection.

- **boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)** Removes all the elements in the specified collection from the collection.

- **boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c)** Removes all elements from the collection except those that are present in the specified collection.

- **void clear()** Removes all elements from the collection.

- **Object[] toArray()** Returns an array containing all the elements in the collection.

- **<T> T[] toArray(T[] a)** Returns an array containing all the elements in the collection, using the provided array if it is large enough. The runtime type of the returned array is the same as the specified array.

- **Iterator<E> iterator()** Returns an iterator over the elements in the collection, allowing sequential access to the elements.

These methods provide the basic operations for adding, removing, querying, and manipulating elements in a collection. Implementations of the Collection interface, such as ArrayList, HashSet, and LinkedList, provide their own specific implementations of these methods to suit their respective collection types.

It's important to note that the Collection interface does not specify methods for indexed access or positional operations. For those functionalities, you would typically use the List interface, which extends Collection and provides additional methods for working with ordered collections.

## Can you explain briefly about the List Interface?
</summary>
The List interface is a fundamental part of the Java Collections Framework. It represents an ordered collection of elements, allowing duplicate values and maintaining the insertion order. In other words, a List is an ordered sequence of elements that can be accessed by their index.

Here are some key characteristics of the List interface:

- **Ordered** Elements in a List are arranged in a specific order. The order of elements is typically determined by the order of their insertion into the List.

- **Indexed Access** Each element in a List has an associated index value starting from 0. This allows for efficient random access to elements by their index. You can retrieve, update, or remove elements using their index.

- **Duplicates** Unlike some other collection types, Lists allow duplicate elements. It means you can have multiple occurrences of the same value within a List.

The List interface defines several methods to work with lists, including:

- **Adding and removing elements** You can add elements to the List using methods like add() and addAll(), and remove elements using remove() or removeAll(). The List interface also provides methods for removing elements at specific indices.

- **Accessing elements** You can access elements by their index using get(). The size of the List can be obtained using size().

- **Searching and sorting** The List interface includes methods such as contains(), indexOf(), and lastIndexOf() to search for elements within the list. It also provides a sort() method to sort the elements of the List.

- **Iterating over elements** You can iterate over the elements of a List using traditional for loops, enhanced for loops, or the Iterator and ListIterator interfaces.

- **Modifying elements** The List interface provides methods to modify elements at specific indices using set(), which allows you to update an element at a given position.

Several classes in Java implement the List interface, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector. These classes provide different implementations with varying performance characteristics and usage scenarios.

By utilizing the List interface, you can easily work with ordered collections of elements, perform operations like insertion, deletion, retrieval, and modification efficiently.

## Explain about ArrayList with an example?
</summary>
The ArrayList class in Java is an implementation of the List interface that uses a dynamically resizable array to store elements. It provides a flexible and efficient way to work with ordered collections of objects. Let's walk through an example to understand how ArrayList works:

      import java.util.ArrayList;

      public class ArrayListExample {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              // Create an ArrayList to store integers
              ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();

              // Add elements to the ArrayList
              numbers.add(10);
              numbers.add(20);
              numbers.add(30);
              numbers.add(40);

              // Access elements by index
              System.out.println("Element at index 2: " + numbers.get(2));  // Output: 30

              // Update an element at a specific index
              numbers.set(1, 25);
              System.out.println("Updated element at index 1: " + numbers.get(1));  // Output: 25

              // Remove an element by value
              numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(30));

              // Remove an element by index
              numbers.remove(0);

              // Iterate over the elements using a for-each loop
              for (Integer number : numbers) {
                  System.out.println(number);
              }
          }
      }

## Can an ArrayList have Duplicate elements?
</summary>
Yes, an ArrayList can have duplicate elements. The ArrayList class allows duplicate elements, meaning you can add multiple occurrences of the same value to the list.

Here's an example to demonstrate adding duplicate elements to an ArrayList:
      
      import java.util.ArrayList;

      public class ArrayListExample {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();

              // Adding duplicate elements
              fruits.add("apple");
              fruits.add("banana");
              fruits.add("apple");
              fruits.add("orange");
              fruits.add("banana");

              System.out.println(fruits);
          }
      }

In this example, we create an ArrayList named fruits to store strings. We add multiple elements to the list, including duplicates such as "apple" and "banana". When we print the ArrayList, it will display all the elements, including the duplicate ones:

## How do you iterate around an ArrayList using Iterator?
</summary>
To iterate over an ArrayList using an Iterator, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the ArrayList and add elements to it.
2. Obtain an Iterator object by calling the iterator() method on the ArrayList.
3. Use the hasNext() method of the Iterator to check if there are more elements in the ArrayList.
4. Inside a loop, use the next() method of the Iterator to retrieve the next element.
5. Perform the desired operations with each element within the loop.
Here's an example that demonstrates iterating over an ArrayList using an Iterator:

          import java.util.ArrayList;
          import java.util.Iterator;
          public class ArrayListIteratorExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
              ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
              // Add elements to the ArrayList
              fruits.add("apple");
              fruits.add("banana");
              fruits.add("orange");

              // Obtain an Iterator object
              Iterator<String> iterator = fruits.iterator();

              // Iterate over the ArrayList using the Iterator
              while (iterator.hasNext()) {
                  String fruit = iterator.next();
                  System.out.println(fruit);
              }
            }
          }

</details>
<details><summary>
	
## How do you sort an ArrayList?
</summary>
To sort an ArrayList in Java, you can use the Collections.sort() method. The Collections class provides a static sort() method that allows you to sort a List in ascending order based on the natural ordering of its elements or a specified comparator.

Here's an example that demonstrates sorting an ArrayList of integers:

        import java.util.ArrayList;
        import java.util.Collections;
        import java.util.Comparator;

        public class ArrayListSortExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();

                // Add elements to the ArrayList
                fruits.add("apple");
                fruits.add("banana");
                fruits.add("orange");
                fruits.add("pear");

                // Sort the ArrayList in acending order
                Collections.sort(fruits);

                // Print the sorted ArrayList
                System.out.println(fruits);

                // Sort the ArrayList in descending order
                Collections.sort(fruits, Comparator.reverseOrder());

                // Print the sorted ArrayList
                System.out.println(fruits);
            }
        }

## How do you sort elements in an ArrayList using Comparable interface?
</summary>
To sort elements in an ArrayList using the Comparable interface, you need to implement the Comparable interface in the class of the elements you want to sort. The Comparable interface provides a method called compareTo() that defines the natural ordering of objects.

Here's an example that demonstrates sorting an ArrayList of custom objects using the Comparable interface:

        import java.util.ArrayList;
        import java.util.Collections;

        public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
            private int id;
            private String name;

            public Student(int id, String name) {
                this.id = id;
                this.name = name;
            }

            public int getId() {
                return id;
            }

            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }

            @Override
            public int compareTo(Student other) {
                // Compare students based on their IDs
                return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id);
            }

            @Override
            public String toString() {
                return "Student{" +
                        "id=" + id +
                        ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                        '}';
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
                students.add(new Student(2, "Alice"));
                students.add(new Student(1, "Bob"));
                students.add(new Student(3, "Charlie"));

                // Sort the ArrayList
                Collections.sort(students);

                // Print the sorted ArrayList
                System.out.println(students);
            }
        }

</details>
<details><summary>
	
## How do you sort elements in an ArrayList using Comparator interface?
</summary>
To sort elements in an ArrayList using the Comparator interface, you need to create a separate class that implements the Comparator interface or use an anonymous class or lambda expression. The Comparator interface allows you to define custom comparison logic for sorting objects.

Here's an example that demonstrates sorting an ArrayList of custom objects using the Comparator interface:

        import java.util.ArrayList;
        import java.util.Collections;
        import java.util.Comparator;

        public class Student {
            private int id;
            private String name;

            public Student(int id, String name) {
                this.id = id;
                this.name = name;
            }

            public int getId() {
                return id;
            }

            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }

            @Override
            public String toString() {
                return "Student{" +
                        "id=" + id +
                        ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                        '}';
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
                students.add(new Student(2, "Alice"));
                students.add(new Student(1, "Bob"));
                students.add(new Student(3, "Charlie"));

                // Create a Comparator to sort students based on their IDs
                Comparator<Student> idComparator = new Comparator<Student>() {
                    @Override
                    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
                        return Integer.compare(s1.getId(), s2.getId());
                    }
                };

                // Sort the ArrayList using the Comparator
                Collections.sort(students, idComparator);

                // Print the sorted ArrayList
                System.out.println(students);
            }
        }

## What is Vector class? How is it different from an ArrayList?
</summary>
In computer programming, a Vector class typically refers to a data structure that represents a dynamic array. It is a commonly used container in many programming languages, including Java.

A Vector is similar to an ArrayList in that both can store and manipulate collections of elements. However, there are a few key differences between the two:

- **Synchronization** Vectors are synchronized, meaning they are thread-safe. This ensures that multiple threads can safely access and modify a Vector object concurrently without causing data corruption or inconsistent state. ArrayLists, on the other hand, are not synchronized by default.

- **Performance** Due to their synchronized nature, Vectors tend to have slightly lower performance compared to ArrayLists, especially in multi-threaded scenarios. The synchronization overhead can introduce additional processing time. ArrayLists, being unsynchronized, generally offer better performance.

- **Growth** Vectors and ArrayLists handle growth differently. When a Vector needs to accommodate more elements than its current capacity allows, it automatically increases its size by a certain amount (a capacity increment). In contrast, ArrayLists grow by 50% of their current size when they need more capacity.

- **Legacy** Vectors were introduced in the early versions of Java and have been available since Java 1.0. ArrayLists were added in Java 1.2 as part of the Java Collections Framework. ArrayLists are considered a more modern alternative to Vectors and provide greater flexibility in most use cases.

In general, unless you specifically require thread-safe behavior, it is recommended to use ArrayLists instead of Vectors for better performance.

## What is LinkedList? How is it different from an ArrayList?
</summary>
In computer programming, a LinkedList is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the list. It consists of nodes, where each node contains the element and a reference (or link) to the next node.

In Java, the LinkedList class is provided as part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the List interface. Additionally, it implements the Deque interface, which extends the Queue interface, making LinkedList a double-ended queue.

Here are the key differences between a LinkedList and an ArrayList:

- **Internal Structure** LinkedList internally maintains a doubly linked list of nodes, where each node has a reference to both the previous and next nodes. On the other hand, ArrayList internally uses a dynamically resizing array to store its elements.

- **Insertion and Deletion** LinkedList performs better than ArrayList when it comes to frequent insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or middle of the list. Since LinkedList only needs to adjust the links between nodes, it has a constant time complexity of O(1) for such operations. In contrast, ArrayList needs to shift elements in the array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

- **Random Access** ArrayList provides faster random access to elements. Given an index, ArrayList can directly access the corresponding element in constant time O(1). LinkedList requires traversing the list from the beginning or end to reach the desired index, resulting in a time complexity of O(n/2), where n is the number of elements in the list.

- **Memory Overhead** LinkedList has a higher memory overhead compared to ArrayList. In addition to storing the elements, LinkedList also needs to store references to the next and previous nodes, leading to more memory usage per element. ArrayList, being backed by an array, has less memory overhead.

In summary, LinkedList is suitable when you frequently perform insertions and deletions in the middle of the list, while ArrayList is more efficient for random access and provides better performance when you mostly access elements by their indices.

## Can you briefly explain about the Set Interface?
</summary>
In Java, the Set interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and represents a collection of unique elements. It is an interface that extends the Collection interface and defines the behavior of a set, which is a mathematical concept where each element occurs only once.
</details>
<details><summary>
	
## What are the important interfaces related to the Set Interface?
</summary>
The Set interface in Java provides a collection of unique elements with no defined order. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and is implemented by classes such as HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. The Set interface itself doesn't declare any new methods but inherits methods from the Collection interface.

Here are some important interfaces related to the Set interface:

- **Set** The Set interface itself is an important interface related to the Set interface. It defines the basic behavior and operations for a collection that stores unique elements. It extends the Collection interface and doesn't introduce any additional methods.

- **SortedSet** The SortedSet interface extends the Set interface and adds sorting functionality to the Set. It maintains the elements in ascending order or according to a specified Comparator. This interface introduces methods for retrieving elements based on their position in the sorted set, such as first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet(), and subSet().

- **NavigableSet** The NavigableSet interface extends the SortedSet interface and provides additional navigation methods for retrieving elements based on their relationship to other elements in the set. It introduces methods like lower(), floor(), ceiling(), higher(), pollFirst(), and pollLast().

- **HashSet** HashSet is a class that implements the Set interface and stores elements using a hash table data structure. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for elements. However, it doesn't guarantee any specific order for the elements.

- **TreeSet** TreeSet is a class that implements both the SortedSet and NavigableSet interfaces. It stores elements in a sorted order defined by either their natural order or a custom Comparator. It provides efficient performance for accessing elements in sorted order but may have slightly slower performance for basic operations compared to HashSet.

- **LinkedHashSet** LinkedHashSet is a class that implements the Set interface and maintains the insertion order of elements, in addition to ensuring uniqueness. It uses a hash table with a linked list running through it to maintain the order of insertion. It provides predictable iteration order, which is the order in which elements were added.

These interfaces and classes provide various functionalities and implementations for working with sets in Java, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your requirements.
</details>
<details><summary>
	
## What is the difference between Set and SortedSet interfaces?
</summary>
The main difference between the Set and SortedSet interfaces in Java is as follows:

### Set Interface:

- Represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
- Does not allow duplicate elements.
- No specific order is guaranteed.
- Examples: HashSet, LinkedHashSet.
### SortedSet Interface:

- Extends the Set interface.
- Represents a sorted collection of unique elements.
- Maintains elements in ascending order (natural order) or as per a specified Comparator.
- Does not allow duplicate elements.
- Provides additional methods for accessing elements based on their position in the sorted set.
- Examples: TreeSet.
In summary, while the Set interface does not impose any specific order on its elements, the SortedSet interface ensures that the elements are stored in a sorted order. The choice between these interfaces depends on whether you need a sorted collection and if maintaining a specific order is important for your use case.
</details>
<details><summary>
	
## Can you give examples of classes that implement the Set Interface?
</summary>
Certainly! Here are some examples of classes that implement the Set interface in Java:

- **HashSet** HashSet is one of the most commonly used implementations of the Set interface. It stores elements in a hash table, providing constant-time performance for basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching elements. However, it does not guarantee any specific order for the elements.

- **LinkedHashSet** LinkedHashSet is another implementation of the Set interface that maintains the insertion order of elements. It uses a combination of a hash table and a linked list, providing predictable iteration order based on the order in which elements were added.

- **TreeSet** TreeSet is an implementation of the SortedSet interface, which extends the Set interface. It stores elements in a sorted order defined by either their natural order or a custom Comparator. TreeSet uses a balanced binary tree (specifically, a red-black tree) internally, which allows for efficient access and retrieval of elements in sorted order.

These are just a few examples of classes that implement the Set interface in Java. Depending on your specific requirements, you can choose the appropriate implementation based on factors such as ordering, performance, and element uniqueness.

## What is a HashSet?
</summary>
HashSet is a class in Java that implements the Set interface. It provides a collection of unique elements with no defined order. Some important characteristics of HashSet include:

- **Uniqueness** HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. If you attempt to add an element that already exists in the set, it won't be added again.

- **Hash Table Implementation** HashSet uses a hash table data structure to store and retrieve elements efficiently. It internally employs hashing techniques to compute the hash code of elements, distributing them across buckets within the hash table.

- **Performance** HashSet offers constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for elements. The performance remains consistent regardless of the size of the HashSet.

- **No Order** The elements in a HashSet are not stored in any particular order. When iterating over a HashSet, the order of element retrieval may vary between iterations or when elements are added or removed.

- **Null Values** HashSet allows storing a single null value. If you attempt to add multiple null values, only one null value will be stored.

HashSet provides an efficient way to store and work with a collection of unique elements, without any specific ordering requirements. It is commonly used when you need to check for element existence or eliminate duplicates from a collection.
</details>
<details><summary>
	
## What is a LinkedHashSet? How is different from a HashSet?
</summary>
In Java, LinkedHashSet is a class that extends HashSet and implements the Set interface. It combines the features of both HashSet and LinkedHashSet, providing a collection of unique elements with predictable iteration order based on the insertion order of elements.

Here are the key differences between LinkedHashSet and HashSet:

- **Insertion Order** LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of elements. When iterating over a LinkedHashSet, the elements are retrieved in the same order they were added. On the other hand, HashSet does not maintain any particular order for its elements.

- **Data Structure** LinkedHashSet uses a combination of a hash table and a linked list to store and retrieve elements. The underlying hash table allows for efficient element access and eliminates duplicates, while the linked list maintains the order of element insertion. HashSet, on the other hand, uses only a hash table data structure.

- **Performance** The performance characteristics of LinkedHashSet are slightly slower than HashSet due to the additional overhead of maintaining the linked list for maintaining the order. HashSet generally provides better performance for basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching elements.

- **Null Values** Both LinkedHashSet and HashSet allow storing a single null value. However, if you attempt to add multiple null values, only one null value will be stored in both cases.

In summary, LinkedHashSet provides the benefits of both HashSet (efficient element access and elimination of duplicates) and LinkedHashSet (predictable iteration order based on insertion). If you require a set implementation that maintains the insertion order of elements, LinkedHashSet is a suitable choice. If ordering is not important and you prioritize slightly better performance, HashSet may be preferable.

## What is a TreeSet? How is different from a HashSet?
</summary>
In Java, TreeSet is a class that implements the SortedSet interface and provides a collection of unique elements in a sorted order. It uses a balanced binary tree (specifically, a red-black tree) as its underlying data structure to store and retrieve elements efficiently.

Here are the key differences between TreeSet and HashSet:

- **Ordering** TreeSet maintains the elements in a sorted order, either according to their natural order or a specified Comparator. The elements are arranged in ascending order. On the other hand, HashSet does not provide any particular order for its elements.

- **Data Structure** TreeSet uses a balanced binary tree (red-black tree) to store and organize elements. This data structure ensures that the elements are always sorted and allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. HashSet, on the other hand, uses a hash table data structure.

- **Performance** TreeSet provides a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for basic operations like adding, removing, and searching elements. The balanced binary tree structure allows efficient access to elements in sorted order. In contrast, HashSet offers constant time complexity (O(1)) for these operations, but it does not provide any sorting guarantees.

- **Null Values** TreeSet does not allow null values since it relies on natural ordering or the provided Comparator to determine the order. On the other hand, HashSet allows a single null value to be stored.

- **Use Case** TreeSet is particularly useful when you need elements to be stored in sorted order or when you require operations like retrieving the first or last element, finding elements greater than or less than a given value, or obtaining a range of elements. HashSet, on the other hand, is suitable when you don't need any particular order or when you prioritize constant-time performance.

In summary, TreeSet maintains elements in sorted order using a balanced binary tree, providing efficient sorted operations. HashSet does not guarantee any specific order but offers constant-time performance for basic operations. The choice between TreeSet and HashSet depends on whether you require sorted order and additional sorted set operations or prefer constant-time performance and no specific order requirements.

## Can you give examples of implementations of NavigableSet?
</summary>
Certainly! Here are some examples of implementations of the NavigableSet interface in Java:

- **TreeSet** TreeSet is a commonly used implementation of the NavigableSet interface. It extends the SortedSet interface and provides a sorted collection of unique elements. TreeSet maintains the elements in ascending order (natural order) or as per a specified Comparator. It offers additional navigation methods such as lower(), floor(), ceiling(), higher(), pollFirst(), and pollLast() to retrieve elements based on their relationship to other elements in the set.

- **TreeSet with custom Comparator** You can also create a TreeSet instance with a custom Comparator to define a specific sorting order for the elements. By providing a Comparator during the TreeSet creation, you can have control over the ordering of the elements.

These are a few examples of implementations of the NavigableSet interface. NavigableSet provides additional navigation methods that allow you to retrieve elements based on their relationship to other elements in the set. The choice of implementation depends on factors such as sorting requirements, concurrency needs, and specific ordering criteria.

## Explain briefly about Queue Interface?
</summary>
The Queue interface in Java represents a collection that orders elements in a specific way to facilitate specific operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements. It follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, where elements are processed in the same order they were added to the queue.

Here are some key features of the Queue interface:

- **Ordering** The Queue interface maintains the order of elements according to the FIFO principle. The element that has been in the queue for the longest time is the first one to be processed (removed) when elements are retrieved.

- **Operations** The Queue interface provides various methods to perform operations on the queue, such as adding elements to the end of the queue (enqueue/offer), removing elements from the front of the queue (dequeue/poll), accessing the element at the front of the queue (peek), and checking if the queue is empty.

- **Implementations** Java provides several implementations of the Queue interface, including LinkedList, ArrayDeque, and PriorityQueue. The choice of implementation depends on factors such as the specific requirements of your application, the expected size of the queue, and the desired performance characteristics.

- **Interface Hierarchy** The Queue interface extends the Collection interface and adds specific queue-related operations. It also extends the Iterable interface, which allows iterating over the elements of the queue using the foreach loop or an iterator.

Queues are commonly used in scenarios where elements need to be processed in the order they were added, such as handling tasks in a multi-threaded environment, implementing job scheduling systems, or modeling real-life scenarios like waiting lines or event handling. The Queue interface provides a standardized way to work with such collections and offers flexibility in choosing the appropriate implementation based on your specific needs.

## Can you briefly explain about the Map Interface?
</summary>
Certainly! The Map interface in Java represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value. It provides methods to store, retrieve, and manipulate data based on the keys.

Here are some key features of the Map interface:

- **Key-Value Pairs** The Map interface stores elements as key-value pairs. Each key in the map is unique and is associated with a specific value. This allows for efficient retrieval of values based on their corresponding keys.

- **Uniqueness of Keys** In a Map, each key must be unique. If you attempt to add a key-value pair with a key that already exists in the map, the existing value is overwritten with the new value.

- **Operations** The Map interface provides methods to add key-value pairs, remove pairs, retrieve values based on keys, check for the presence of a specific key or value, iterate over the map's entries, and more.

- **Implementations** Java provides several implementations of the Map interface, including HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, and ConcurrentHashMap. The choice of implementation depends on factors such as the expected size of the map, the desired performance characteristics, the need for ordered iteration, and thread safety requirements.

- **Interface Hierarchy** The Map interface extends the Collection interface and provides additional methods specific to key-value mappings. It also provides keyset, values, and entrySet views, allowing access to the keys, values, and entries of the map.

Maps are commonly used in various applications for efficient storage and retrieval of data based on keys. They are useful when you need to associate values with unique identifiers or perform lookups based on specific keys. The Map interface provides a standardized way to work with such collections and offers flexibility in choosing the appropriate implementation based on your specific requirements.

## What is difference between Map and SortedMap?
</summary>
The main difference between the Map and SortedMap interfaces in Java lies in the ordering of their keys. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

- **Ordering** The Map interface does not enforce any particular order on its keys. The keys can be stored and retrieved in an arbitrary order, which is implementation-dependent. On the other hand, the SortedMap interface guarantees that the keys are sorted in ascending order based on their natural ordering or a specified Comparator.

- **Additional Operations** The SortedMap interface extends the Map interface and provides additional methods related to key ordering. It offers operations like firstKey(), lastKey(), headMap(), tailMap(), and subMap(), which allow you to retrieve views of the map based on ranges or specific keys.

- **Implementations** In terms of implementations, the Map interface has several implementations such as HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and ConcurrentHashMap, which do not guarantee any specific key order. The SortedMap interface has its own implementation called TreeMap, which maintains the keys in a sorted order using a binary search tree.

- **Use Cases** The Map interface is suitable when you need to associate values with unique keys without any specific order requirement. It provides efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. The SortedMap interface, on the other hand, is used when you require the keys to be stored and accessed in a specific order. It is useful for scenarios where you need to iterate over the keys in a sorted manner or perform operations based on key ranges.

In summary, the main distinction between the Map and SortedMap interfaces is the ordering of keys. Map does not guarantee any order, while SortedMap ensures that the keys are sorted. The choice between the two interfaces depends on whether you require a specific key ordering and the additional operations provided by the SortedMap interface.

## What is a HashMap?
</summary>
In Java, HashMap is a class that implements the Map interface and provides a collection of key-value pairs. It uses a hash table data structure to store and retrieve elements efficiently. HashMap allows null keys and null values, and it does not maintain any specific order of elements.

Here are the key characteristics of HashMap:

- **Key-Value Pairs** HashMap stores elements as key-value pairs. Each key in the map is unique, and it is associated with a specific value. This allows for efficient retrieval of values based on their corresponding keys.

- **Hash Table Implementation** HashMap internally uses a hash table to store and organize its elements. It uses a hash function to compute the hash code of keys, which determines the position of the key-value pair in the hash table. This provides fast access and retrieval of elements.

- **Performance** HashMap offers constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like adding, removing, and retrieving elements. The performance remains consistent regardless of the size of the HashMap, as long as the hash function distributes the elements evenly across the hash table.

- **No Order** HashMap does not maintain any specific order of elements. When iterating over a HashMap, the order of element retrieval may vary between iterations or when elements are added or removed. If you need a specific order, you can use the LinkedHashMap class, which extends HashMap and maintains the insertion order of elements.

- **Null Keys and Values** HashMap allows storing a single null key and multiple null values. If you attempt to add multiple entries with the same key, the previous value associated with that key will be overwritten.

HashMap is commonly used in various applications for efficient key-value storage and retrieval. It provides a flexible and efficient way to map keys to values, allowing for fast access to elements based on their keys.

## What are the different methods in a Hash Map?
</summary>
HashMap in Java provides various methods to manipulate and access its elements. Here are some important methods of the HashMap class:

- **put(key, value)** Inserts the specified key-value pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists, the value is replaced with the new value. Returns the previous value associated with the key, or null if the key is new.

- **get(key)** Returns the value associated with the specified key in the HashMap. If the key is not found, it returns null.

- **remove(key)** Removes the key-value pair associated with the specified key from the HashMap. Returns the value that was removed, or null if the key is not found.

- **containsKey(key)** Checks if the HashMap contains the specified key. Returns true if the key is found, false otherwise.

- **containsValue(value)** Checks if the HashMap contains the specified value. Returns true if the value is found, false otherwise.

- **size()** Returns the number of key-value pairs (entries) in the HashMap.

- **isEmpty()** Checks if the HashMap is empty. Returns true if it contains no entries, false otherwise.

- **keySet()** Returns a Set of all the keys in the HashMap.

- **values()** Returns a Collection of all the values in the HashMap.

- **entrySet()** Returns a Set of all the key-value pairs (entries) in the HashMap as Map.Entry objects.

- **clear()** Removes all the key-value pairs from the HashMap, making it empty.

These are some of the commonly used methods provided by the HashMap class. These methods allow you to add, retrieve, remove, and perform other operations on the key-value pairs stored in the HashMap.

In summary, TreeMap maintains elements in a sorted order using a balanced binary search tree, providing efficient sorted operations. HashMap does not guarantee any specific order but offers constant-time performance for basic operations. The choice between TreeMap and HashMap depends on whether you require sorted order and additional sorted map operations or prefer constant-time performance and do not require any specific ordering.

</summary>

Comparable	Comparator
1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.	The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2) Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.	Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.	Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.	A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.	We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.
