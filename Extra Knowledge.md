## Difference between API and REST API?
</summary>
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is a specific type of API that adheres to the constraints of the REST architectural style. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is a style of web architecture that governs the behavior of clients and servers. REST APIs use HTTP requests to interact with data. Traditional APIs can use a variety of protocols.
REST APIs are also known as RESTful APIs. When a client requests a resource using a REST API, the server transfers back the current state of the resource in a standardized representation.
