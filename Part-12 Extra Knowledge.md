## Difference between API and REST API?
</summary>
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is a specific type of API that adheres to the constraints of the REST architectural style. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is a style of web architecture that governs the behavior of clients and servers. REST APIs use HTTP requests to interact with data. Traditional APIs can use a variety of protocols.
REST APIs are also known as RESTful APIs. When a client requests a resource using a REST API, the server transfers back the current state of the resource in a standardized representation.

## What is domain vs. endpoint in API?
</summary>
A domain is a library of common components, such as parameters, responses, and data models, that are used across multiple API definitions. An endpoint is a component of an API. It's a specific location within an API that accepts requests and sends back responses.
Endpoints are the locations of the resources, and the API uses endpoint URLs to retrieve the requested resources. For example, assuming the base URL of https://api.example.com/v1, the /users endpoint refers to https://api.example.com/v1/users.
APIs work by sending requests for information from a web application or web server and receiving a response.

## Difference between Http and Https?
</summary>

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary protocol for transmitting information across the internet. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a more secure version of HTTP. The main difference between the two is that HTTPS uses encryption to protect information as it is sent between clients and servers. HTTPS encrypts data entered into a user's device and data going from the website to the browser. This makes it difficult for anyone to intercept information like passwords or credit card numbers.

Here are some other differences between HTTP and HTTPS:
- HTTP sends data over port 80, while HTTPS uses port 443.
- HTTP operates at the application layer, while HTTPS operates at the transport layer.
- HTTP transfers data in plain text, while HTTPS transfers data in cipher text.
- HTTP is faster than HTTPS because HTTPS consumes computation power to encrypt the communication channel.
HTTPS requires an SSL certificate and a CA signature, while HTTP does not require SSL certificates.
